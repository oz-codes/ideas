creating a personal programming language based off of a general abstract machine; ideally the goal is to emulate a series of low level calls (such as variable definition/register storage, bitwise and mathematical operations, flow control through jumping across execution frames, etc), then design an actual language around those and write the parser and lexer to get them done. there are some candidate ideas within the github repository already.

todo: 
* actually determine the language syntax and semantics
* figure out the stylistic properties of the language
* implement lexer and parser
* implement basic opcodes
* write test programs to verify features
