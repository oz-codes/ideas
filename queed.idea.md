*oz.smoqueed.com* is a subdomain that i was given by a friend; i want to sort of use it to implement a sort of interactive fiction-esque MUSH with a web frontend

to-do:
* finish creating the main state class to store state for the in-game universe
* design some areas that can be walked to and from 
* implement classes to contain arbitrary objects, etc, in game
* try not to be an absolute moron and forget!
