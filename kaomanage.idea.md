#kaomanage

short for *kao*moji *manage*r; essentially a process that monitors all input for specific configurations of characters (eg. :happy :sad :thumbsup etc, but they are to be customizable so they can be whatever you want) and when that specific configuration occurs, it performs a lookup to a specific theme of kaomoji (in the prior example, the different "configurations of characters"/keywords served a semantic purpose as well which identified the theme, but this isn't strictly required though it is a good choice wrt style and consistency). once it encounters one of those keywords, it performs the aforementioned lookup for that theme to get a list of emoji that you picked for that theme, and then will randomly pick one from the list. also important to support weighting based on the total amount of usage (everything starts with a weight of 0 and that is incremented every time (represented in this case as the amount of documents being used for that theme) , so the user can influence the more preferred ones) not sure really how to implement the whole "watch all input" thing; possibly do something with autohotkey
