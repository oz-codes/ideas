*dextro.space* is a domain that I sort of bought on a whim in hopes of creating a harm reduction community/social network for users of dextromethorphan hbr to come to and have discussions in an open and non-hostile environment, having been a heavy user of said substance in the past and wishing to support others in their endeavors 

to-do:
* figure out what kind of community to create
* determine server arch (what stack? hand-made, or use pre-existing FOSS?)
* promote to members of dxm related groups around the internet
