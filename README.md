# ideas

just sort of a to-do list for ideas i come up with that i don't want to forget

## Current Ideas
* nn-vst: a vst type instrument that is a neural network which trains on a series of samples in order to generate something that approximates the raw pcm data within them (eg, train on a bunch of piano samples, and you have a piano)
* maschine: personal programming language project (lexer/parser/machine implemented in ruby)
* cultofoz: focus on building website for cult-of-oz discord/fb group, and expanding and promoting the community
* dextro.space: harm reduction community for dxm
* m0c.us: LoA, other ideas
* oz.smoqueed.com: web based MUSH/IF-esque concept
