*m0c.us* is a domain that i bought on a whim just to have a place to store files that i have no place for otherwise; that being said, however, i do have ideas for things that i want to do with it, namely a website for the Library of Alexandria (more details soon)

to-do:
* work with "i am" to determine the nature of the LoA server
* get LoA site set up 
* determine other ideas to work on
